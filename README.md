Bluetooth Hopping Pattern Visualisation
=======================================

This is a simple visualisation of the Bluetooth hopping pattern to help to
explain FHSS signals and how this interacts with 802.11 and other 2.4GHz
signals.

It is very early and rough, all contributions welcome.

Dependencies
